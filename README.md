# StringArtGenerator
Web based string art generator

This project is heavily based on the work of reddit user /u/kmmeerts from his post: https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/au0ilz/made_a_string_art_portrait_out_of_a_continuous_2/
Fork of halfmonty's work at https://github.com/halfmonty/StringArtGenerator

To use the original circle generator, navigate to: https://halfmonty.github.io/StringArtGenerator/

This version which includes a rectangle generator is available at https://greyphilosophy.github.io/StringArtGenerator/, with a severe limitation that it will force every image into a square shape. If you want a rectangle to work you have to first stretch and square your image. With future canvas work this limitation may one day be overcome.
